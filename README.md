# scope-capture Flappy Bird demo

This project was forked from Bruce Hauman's [flappy-bird-demo](https://github.com/bhauman/flappy-bird-demo), 
 to demonstrate how to add [scope-capture](https://github.com/vvvvalvalval/scope-capture) to a Figwheel project.
 
Diffs:
 
* [Adding scope-capture to the project](https://github.com/vvvvalvalval/scope-capture-flappy-bird-demo/compare/scope-capture-fork...add-scope-capture)  
* [Adding a spy block](https://github.com/vvvvalvalval/scope-capture-flappy-bird-demo/compare/add-scope-capture...use-scope-capture)
